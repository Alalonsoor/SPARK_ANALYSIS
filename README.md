# SPARK_ANALYSIS

Comparison of Apache Spark and single-machine Pandas for processing a large dataset of movies.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the project is to compare the performance and processing capacity of Apache Spark and Pandas on a single machine. It shows data processing pipelines for movie rating analysis based on the MovieLens dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset employed is from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which has movies, tags, and ratings data.

You can download the data from MovieLens and utilize files such as 'movies.csv', 'ratings.csv', and 'tags.csv' for analysis.

## Pipeline Overview

- Data loading and preprocessing (join operations, filtering).
- Calculation of average ratings and movie classification.
- Performance measurement of Spark and Pandas implementations.
